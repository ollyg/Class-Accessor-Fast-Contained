NAME
    Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained - Fast accessors with data containment

VERSION
    This document refers to version 0.05 of
    Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained, released Tuesday Sep 19, 2006.

SYNOPSIS
     package Foo;
     use base qw(Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained);

     # The rest is the same as Class::Accessor::Fast

DESCRIPTION
    This module does two things differently to the venerable
    Class::Accessor::Fast :

    *   Fields are stored at arms-length within a single hash value of
        $self, rather than directly in the $self blessed referent.

    *   "new()" allows mixin into an existing object, rather than creating
        and returning a new blessed hashref. To do this, just call something
        like:

         my $self = Some::Other::Class->new;
         $self = $self->Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained::new;

        Note that the mixin code only supports objects which use a blessed
        hash reference or a blessed typeglob reference.

        An alias "setup()" is available which does the same as "new()" but
        might make more sense if being used in this way.

DEPENDENCIES
    Other than the standard Perl distribution, you will need the following:

    *   Class::Accessor
