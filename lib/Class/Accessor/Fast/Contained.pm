=head1 NAME

Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained - Fast accessors with data containment

=head1 VERSION

This document refers to version 1.01 of Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 package Foo;
 use base qw(Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained);

 # The rest is the same as Class::Accessor::Fast

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module does two things differently to the venerable Class::Accessor::Fast :

=over 4

=item *

Fields are stored at arms-length within a single hash value of $self, rather
than directly in the $self blessed referent.

=item *

C<new()> allows mixin into an existing object, rather than creating and
returning a new blessed hashref. To do this, just call something like:

 my $self = Some::Other::Class->new;
 $self = $self->Class::Accessor::Fast::Contained::new;

Note that the mixin code only supports objects which use a blessed hash
reference or a blessed typeglob reference.

An alias C<setup()> is available which does the same as C<new()> but might
make more sense if being used in this way.
